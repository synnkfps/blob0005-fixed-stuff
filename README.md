#### blob0005 fixed stuff
fixed blob0005 codes

i can't judge blob0005, hes a kid / hes learning python, he does good stuff but his code techniques are horrible, so i fixed the stuff that i've found most intersting...

things that i noticed:
- he uses code template, all of his codes includes:
- - try to import modules
- - colorama
- - a list with all the alphabet one per one
- - while loops that runs forever
- their looping techniques are terribly done
- -70% optimizated code (runs slower)
- All Of His English Words Are Capitalized

what i fixed on every single file that is on my repo:
- instead of creating a list with 62 elements (all the alphabet letters in upper and lower case), create a single string with all the letters in upper case, then appending to a list its letters + its lower-cased letter
- remove while True loops
- empty inputs after printing something
- setting a input as float/int after its done
- better input answer recognition
